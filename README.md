# About

## Description and Purpose

Momentum is a full-stack fitness consistency platform designed to help beginners and casual gym-goers build sustainable workout habits. Rather than overwhelming users with hundreds of exercise options, Momentum removes decision fatigue by generating personalized daily workout plans based on each user's goals, experience level, available equipment, and weekly schedule.

The app emphasizes long-term consistency over perfection. Users can track their progress through workout history, streaks, and personalized motivational insights while participating in small accountability groups that encourage members to stay committed without the distractions of a traditional social media platform.

Our goal is to make working out feel simple, approachable, and rewarding so that users develop lasting fitness habits.

## Inspiration

Many fitness apps assume users already know how to structure workouts, understand proper training splits, or stay motivated independently. For beginners, this often creates analysis paralysis and causes them to lose consistency before building a routine.

Momentum is inspired by habit-building products such as Duolingo and GitHub contribution streaks, combined with the simplicity of having a personal coach who tells you exactly what to do each day. Instead of rewarding users for lifting the most weight, Momentum celebrates consistency, progress, and small daily victories.
